The three laws of Recursion:
1) A recursive algorithm must have a base case
2) A recursive algorithm must change its state and move towards the base case
3) A recursive algorithm must call itself recursively

Recursive algorithms often take up more memory because they have to hold data on Python's internal stack. 
Recursive functions can also be more difficult than iterative algorithms to read and debug because it can be harder to follow what
is happening.

Vocabulary:
iterative algorithm: An algorithm that solves problems by repeating steps over and over, typically using a loop.
recursion: A method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
base case: A condition that ends a recursive algorithm to stop it from continuing forever.
factorial: The product of all positive integers less than or equal to a number.

Challenge: 
Print the numbers from 1 to 10 recursively.
