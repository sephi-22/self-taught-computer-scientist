Donald Knuth's definition of Algorithm:
A definite, effective, and finite process that receives input and produces output based on this input.
Definiteness = the steps are clear, consice, and unambiguous.
Effectiveness = You can perform each operation precisely to solve the problem
Finiteness = The algorithm stops after a finite number of steps.
